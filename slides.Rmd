- Each team plays 82 games per season
- This allows for every team to play each team at least twice
- The league is split up into two conferences, the East and the West, each with two divisions
-The East has the Metropolitan and the Atlantic divisions while the West has the Central and Pacific divisions.

## The Changes for the 2013-14 season

- Winnipeg Jets move from the Eastern to the Western confrence
- Columbus Blue jackets and Detroit Redwings move from the West to the East

- Changes left the West with two divisions of 14 teams and the East with 2 divisions of 16 teams

- The sampling is meant to test whether or not it is more difficult to reach the playoffs as an eastern confrence team

# Extension 2017-18 season

- This season added the Vegas Golden Knights
- Now the West has one divion of 8 teams and one division of 7 teams
- This creates new probabilities for the required points to make it to the playoffs
